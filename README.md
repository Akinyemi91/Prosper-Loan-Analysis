# Prosper Loan Analysis
## by Akinyemi Akinbode 


## Dataset
This project explores a dataset containing peer-to-peer loan information of approximately 113,000 loans from Prosper Funding LLC with most variables being numeric and categoric.


## Summary of Findings

I was interested in finding out features and relationship between different variables across the dataset and also to find out the variable that is the best predictor of deliquencies.

I was able to find out that the best predictor of deliquencies is Credit rating and not the income that is earned by the borrowers. This lends credence to the importance of good ratings in lending.

I observed that average count of deliquencies did not change at all along income lines. I hypothesized from the start that credit rating will be a good predictor but never could imagine that what individual earn does not really matter in predicting delinquencies.



## Key Insights for Presentation
The presentation was focused on describing a journey of exploring the dataset to discover the most important variable in determining or predicting deliquency. 

I started by introducing the key variables one by one and show the relationshing along univariate, bivariate and multivariate lines. This was able to state the most important factor in predicting deliquency and was in contrary to what i presumed before carrying out the analysis.
